This is a static [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site providing a searchable library of all the algorithms in [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms). All the data about the algorithms gets scraped directly from the git repositories.

## Translating the website

You can help us translate the [TheAlgorithms](https://the-algorithms.com) website using Weblate [here](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/TheAlgorithms/?utm_source=widget). There you can complete the translations for our current languages, or suggest something if you are unsure. Also feel free to add a new language. The current languages are:

## Getting Started

If you haven't installed it yet, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable). Then, install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

After that, run the script that fetches all the algorithms from GitHub:

```bash
yarn fetch-algorithms
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Ready-to-Code Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/website) and easily check how your deployment looks. It will automatically run the commands mentioned above on run.

## Contributing

If you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, create a new branch or fork and commit there. Before opening a PR, be sure to

- Run `yarn lint` and fix potential errors
- Run `yarn build` to check if everything still builds successfully

Open the pull request against `main`. Vercel will automatically create a preview deployment, and the pull request will be squash merged after being reviewed by a member.

## License

The source code of website itself (this repository) is licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/website/blob/main/LICENSE), while all the licenses for the code and explanations on the website can be found in the respective repositories.
